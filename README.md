============================

Hello there. Welcome to bigty.pe where you can type things and they appear quite big, and give you a link to send to a friend. It's great for when you have something big to say.

## Found a bug?

Report it at https://github.com/leebyron/bigtype/issues

## Got an idea?

Check out this repo and play around! Run `npm start` to test it locally, and run [`now`](https://zeit.co/now#get-started) to deploy a live test to share in your pull request.

## Where did this come from?

Built during a hackathon by [@leebyron](https://github.com/leebyron), [@dschafer](https://github.com/dschafer), and [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld), inspired by one of our favorite iOS apps, [Make It Big](http://make-it-big.appstor.io/).
